# The Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Markdown
This guide will walk you through the basic syntax of Markdown. Itâ€™s useful for writing documentation, README files, or notes in plain text that render beautifully on platforms like GitHub.

## Headings
You can create different sized headings by using one to six hash (`#`) symbols followed by a space and your heading text. 
The more hash symbols, the smaller the header:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
```

## Paragraphs
If you want to create a new paragraph,

make sure there's an extra empty line between the two paragraphs.

```markdown

make sure there's an extra empty line between the two paragraphs.
```

## Horizontal Line
Use three dashes, `---`, to draw a horizontal line like:

---

## Lists
You can create a bulleted list by using one asterisk, `*` ,followed by a space:
* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
* Bullet 3

If you want an ordered list, use numbers:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

### Nested lists
To create a nested list, you indent and then add an asterisk or number followed by a space.

Here's an example of a nested unordered list:
* Bullet 1
  * Sub-bullet 1
  * Sub-bullet 2
* Bullet 2

Here's an example of a nested ordered list:
1. First
   1. First indent
   2. Second indent
2. Second

### Mixed lists
You can also have an ordered list with a nested unordered list like this:
1. First
   * Bullet 1
   * Bullet 2
2. Second

Or vice versa, an unordered list with a nested ordered list like this:
* Bullet 1
  1. First item
  2. Second item
* Bullet 2

## Emphasis
If you wrap your text with the following characters, you can add different types of emphasis:

*Italics* and **Bold** and ***Bold and Italics***
```markdown
*Italics* and **Bold** and ***Bold and Italics***
```

~~Strikethrough~~ and <u>underline</u>
```markdown
~~Strikethrough~~ and <u>underline</u>
```

A <sup>superscript</sup> and a <sub>subscript</sub>
```markdown
A <sup>superscript</sup> and a <sub>subscript</sub>
```

## LaTeX
You can add LaTeX equations two ways:

Inline like $C_6H_12O_6$
```markdown
Inline like $C_6H_12O_6$
```

Or displayed on its own line: $$Area = {\pi}r^2$$
```markdown
Or displayed on its own line: $$Area = {\pi}r^2$$
```

## Code Blocks
You can add inline code by adding a set of backticks `inline code`.
To create a code block, enclose the code with a set of three backticks. 
Make sure that you specify the language (e.g., `python`, `bash`, `html`) right after the first three:

```python
# Example of Python code
def greet():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
```

## Blockquote
To create a blockquote, you start each line with a `>`:

> If your blockquote has multiple paragraphs,
> 
> make sure you have any extra line with just '>' between the paragraphs.

## Links
If you want to show the full URL as a clickable link, just paste it directly:

https://www.google.com

But if you want to hyperlink text:
1. Add the text you want to be shown inside a set of brackets  [Link text]
2. Add the url inside a set of parentheses (link)

Example: [Google](https://www.google.com).

```markdown
Example: [Google](https://www.google.com).
```

## Images
To embed an image:
1. Add an exclamation point (!)
2. Add the text representing the image inside a set of brackets  [Alternative text]
3. Add the url to the link inside a set of parentheses (url for image)

Here's an example of the Markdown logo:

![Markdown logo](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR7F0ge8MNuv4S2WaFiwgs-6fQVN5FGWorjJg&s)

```markdown
![Markdown logo](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR7F0ge8MNuv4S2WaFiwgs-6fQVN5FGWorjJg&s)
```

## Tables
To create a table, each line includes pipe (|) symbols to separate columns of the table.
Dashes are also used to separate the headers from the rest of the table.

Here's an example of a table:

| Column 1 | Column 2  |
|----------|-----------|
| Row 1    | Data      |
| Row 2    | More data |

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2  |
|----------|-----------|
| Row 1    | Data      |
| Row 2    | More data |
```

You can align table content by placing `:` on the left, middle, or right side of the dashes underneath the header for that column:

| Left-Aligned | Center Aligned | Right-Aligned |
|:------------ |:--------------:| -------------:|
| Left text    | Center text    | Right text    |

```markdown
| Left-Aligned | Center Aligned | Right-Aligned |
|:------------ |:--------------:| -------------:|
| Left text    | Center text    | Right text    |
```


## Footnotes
In GitHub, you can reference a footnote by writing `[^1]` like this [^1].

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
